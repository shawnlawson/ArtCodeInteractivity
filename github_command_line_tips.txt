This is just a list of a few commands for keeping your fork of the ArtCodeInteractivity repo up-to-date from Shawn's.

First, make sure you have a fork of the repo in the first place.  I'm pretty sure we all do.

Second, you need a local copy of your fork.  Go to the directory/folder you want it in, and type:

	git init

This sets up the directory to handle git repositories.

Then type:

	git clone https://github.com/<your git id goes here>/ArtCodeInteractivity.git

This creates a directory called ArtCodeInteractivity in the current directory, and downloads all the files to your machine.

Next, you need to tell git where to find the original shawnlawson repository:

	git remote add upstream https://github.com/shawnlawson/ArtCodeInteractivity.git

Now, you're set up to pull and merge updates from shawnlawson's:

	git pull upstream master

That last command is the only one you need thereafter.

Once more, to setup:


	git init
	git clone https://github.com/<your git id goes here>/ArtCodeInteractivity.git
	git remote add upstream https://github.com/shawnlawson/ArtCodeInteractivity.git

Then:

	git pull upstream master

as needed.
