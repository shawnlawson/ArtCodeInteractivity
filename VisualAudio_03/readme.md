## Visual && Audio

### Goals:

1. See and Hear
2. Paperize
3. Read


#### 1. See and Hear
Combine Visual and Aural elements. Completed projects will be projected and connected to the speaker system; unless requiring unique viewing/hearing hardware, for example: Oculus Rift. Completed projects are not required to be interactive. Completed projects can be infinitely evolving, reactive, and so on.

#### 2. Paperize
Before getting code dirty, draw/write out the bits and pieces of what you think you'll need. What are the components? How should they connect? Is there an order to events? 

#### 3. Read
In all of these, ski[p,m] the Processing parts.
